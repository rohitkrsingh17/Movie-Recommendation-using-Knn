# Movie Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression. In the context of recommendation systems, KNN can be used to find similar items (movies in this case) based on their features (attributes like genre, actors, etc.).

## Description

The movie recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of other similar users. It works as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on movies and user preferences. This can include information like movie genres, ratings, user demographics, etc.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the movie data. These features can include genre, director, actors, ratings, etc.

3. **Model Training**: Use KNN algorithm to train the recommendation model. This involves finding similar movies based on their features and user ratings.

4. **Recommendation Generation**: Given a user's preferences or a specific movie, the model recommends similar movies based on KNN.
